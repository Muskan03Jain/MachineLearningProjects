# Iris Flower Species Prediction System

This project predicts the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal width and height using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. The project includes data visualization, model training, and deployment using a Streamlit web application.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Species Prediction System

This project classifies Iris flowers into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** based on the measurements of sepal and petal width and height using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-prediction.git
   cd iris-flower-prediction
## Run the Streamlit app for Iris Flower Species Prediction

streamlit run app/iris_streamlit_app.py

##Usage

###Iris Flower Species Prediction System

1)Once the Streamlit app is running, you will see a web interface.
2)Use the provided input fields to enter the sepal and petal dimensions.
3)Click the "Submit" button to get the prediction for the Iris flower species.
Models
The project uses a pre-trained KNN model saved as a pickle file. The model file (knn_iris.pkl) is included in the repository.
